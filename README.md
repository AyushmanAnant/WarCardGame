# WarCardGame
I am excited to announce my first step into iOS app development! As part of the *"Build an App in 8 Days"* program by CodeWithChris, I designed a card war game that lets users play WarCards against the CPU. This project marks the beginning of my journey into app development, and I look forward to creating more innovative apps in the future!
